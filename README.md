# Nextbike Wrapped
I have made this app bc I love Nextbike and Veturilo and wanted to show my skills

### Backend:
Besides providing some quite simple summaries, it's approximating real mileage, assuming that user has always chosen the shortest paths. Shortest distances is calculated via Google Distance Matrix, and data is stored in Neo4j graph database, to minimize amount of paid requests. Algorithm is meant to be both time efficient (could be better) and money saving (cannot precalculate all distances for all cities).

### Frontend:
Coming soon... probably in TS + angular, concentrated on mobiles
